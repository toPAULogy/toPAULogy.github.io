    <center><h3>Hopefully I'll post some things I find interesting here.</h3></center>

    <ul>
      <li><center><div><a href="folder\QF.pdf">What is a Quantum Field?</a>: I will try to explain from a few different perspectives what a quantum field is. This will be a trial run as it will be my first post and I am still not quite sure what I would like the format to be. I'll at to this bit by bit and hopefully it will slowly take shape. (Under construction.) </div></center></li>
      <li><center><div><a href="folder\Knots.pdf">The Jones Polynomial</a>: Outline of a short project for secondary school students. I might also try to explain the link with Chern-Simons theory. (Under construction.)</div></center></li>
